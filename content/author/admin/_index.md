I am a PhD student in the Integrative Anatomy program at the University of Missouri School of Medicine, Columbia, MO. 

I am interested in the functional morphology of the hip and pelvis in humans, primates, and early hominins, especially as it relates to understanding locomotor and ecological diversity in fossil hominins. 

Additionally, I am interested in understanding how anatomical variation contributes to symptoms and biomechanical differences in patients with conditions such as femoroacetabular impingement.
