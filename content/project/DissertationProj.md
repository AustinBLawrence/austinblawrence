title = "__Dissertation Research:__ Effect of hip joint orientation and pelvic morphology on human locomotor biomechanics: Implications for interpreting locomotion in fossil hominins"

# Project summary to display on homepage.
summary = "Bipedal walking is a hallmark of the human lineage. However, it is unclear whether and how the locomotor behaviors of early hominins differed from modern humans and how locomotion affected other aspects of hominin ecology and evolution. This study combines a novel method for measuring skeletal morphology of living subjects with 3D motion analysis to determine how variation in skeletal morphology is related to locomotor performance. Experimentally testing the effects of hominin skeletal morphology on performance is a transformational approach that will produce a validated framework for interpreting locomotor behavior in fossils and testing hypotheses of locomotor diversity in fossil hominins. This work is supported by the Leakey Foundation, Sigma Xi, University of Missouri GPC, and the National Science Foundation."
