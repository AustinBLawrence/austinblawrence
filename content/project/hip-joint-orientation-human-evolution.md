# Project summary to display on homepage.
summary = "The 3D orientation of the human hip joint appears to differ from that of other primates. In this project, we are performing 3D analyses of human, early hominin, and non-human primate pelves to determine how 3D orientation of the acetabulum is related to locomotor behavior among primates and how this may inform our understanding of the origins of hominin bipedality. Collaboration with Drs. Carol Ward (University of Missouri) & Ashley Hammond (American Museum of Natural History) "
